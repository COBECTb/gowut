Changes and new features in v1.3.1:
-----------------------------------

-New SessIDCookieName() and SetSessIDCookieName() methods in Server to get / set
the cookie name used to store the Gowut session ID. Useful if you plan to run
multiple Gowut servers on the same computer with the same app path (on different ports);
you can set different session ID cookie names so they won't collide (#42).

-Added ETypeMouseDown constant, identical to ETypeMousedown.

-Fixed an issue where Table.Clear() could panic if table contained nil components (#23).
